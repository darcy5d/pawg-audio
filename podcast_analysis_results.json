    "transcript": " Before we get going, here's a bit where I remind you that nothing we discussed during the endgame should be considered as investment advice. This conversation is for informational and hopefully entertainment purposes only. So while we hope you find it both informative and entertaining, please do your own research or speak to a financial advisor before putting a dime of your money into these crazy markets. And now, on with the show. Welcome everybody to another edition of the endgame. Joining me for a conversation we've been dying to have a month now is the man himself, the great Bill Fleckas-Dyber, how are the devil are you? I'm just fine and how are you? It's been a while since we've gotten together. It's been a while. It's been a while. This conversation in particular, we have been trying to get on the calendar for what? Six months I think? Yeah, Fred is a very busy fellow, especially when he's down in Costa Rica. He's extra busy. Extra hard to get, shall we say. But it's funny Bill, you know, we tried to get this done. I think about six months ago, we first tried to do it and Fred was busy and then he was traveling and he was going to be down in Costa Rica. And so we put this date in the diary a couple of months ago and we're recording this on the 14th of March and one of the odds after six months of waiting that we would record this the day gold goes through the $3,000 baritone. I can't believe you're surprised what the day we made the date I went on bought $3,000 calls, didn't you? No, I should have done. I was too busy trading monkey jay. Why did it fall to the... Oh, yeah, because you were probably planning on with Bitcoin working out. Yeah, I was just buying the set of monkey jay pigs just regular Thursday. But listen, you know, this is a conversation that I've been looking forward to for so long because of all the voices in the gold space, Fred for me is the one that I listened to the most and he's also the one who brings the whole narrative of gold itself, but also the gold mining stocks in. And his technological bent as well given what I suspect everyone's going to be selling to buy their gold stocks when the panic starts could not be any more apropos I don't think for this conversation. Well, I mean, Fred is literally a world-class analyst. You could have him follow a forest products in no time. He'd no more than 95% of the people who look on the subject. So he and I were been kind of locked together in battle through the tech craze and into the medals and it took a while to get the hang I think of of the ins and outs and the mining stocks, but now he's as good as any analyst you'll find probably better than 99% of the others. The only guys who might be better or long-time insiders to know the geology and mine engineering ice cold, and that's a small group of people. And frankly, that's not the knowledge you need, I think, for the people that are going to listen to this. You don't need to know how to offer it a mine. No, but you need to be sure that the person you're listening to knows how it works. There are gazillion gold stocks and pick a number. Probably 75% are garbage. Maybe that's too harsh, but I mean, garbage in the sense that they're just going to behave like gold does it best because they have nothing special in their mining business and garbage is unfair, but they don't have anything extra, but the price of gold. That's what I mean to say. I completely agree. Well, listen, I tell you what, you and I can sit here and talk about gold all day long, but the people listening, they're drumming their thumbs on their desk, pressing that 15 second forward button until they hear friends' voice. So why don't we bring them in? Okay. Well Fred, welcome to the end game. It's an absolute joy to see you again after quite some time. And Bill and I are particularly excited to have you to talk to because Hungarian politics is obviously the most important subject of the day and who better to talk about it than you? How do you know I've told my expertise? I'm kidding, of course. We've got I.I. Gold. There's so much on the rail that I'm talking about there. So I think we'll start with gold because as Bill and I were saying at the top of the show, we just recorded that before you joined us, having set this conversation up months ago, we happened to be recording it on the day that gold's gone through to $3,000 mark. Not that that really makes any difference whatsoever, but it is a level that everyone's been focusing on and I think a lot of people are taking it as a sign of greater things to come. So I give you the broadest question imaginable because I know you think about this stuff a lot and nobody writes about it as well as you. So let's just if we can start off with just your general thoughts on gold, the metal rather than the mining socks we'll get into those later, where it is, what's put it there and what you think the things that are going to drive it in the months to come. So we've been on a bull market, I say we've been a bull market since the end of 2015 and that's when gold bottomed at $1050, it's tripled now since then. It hit to $2,000 in 2000 and that was around the same time that we had a lot of money being printed related to COVID. But then we went four years where it couldn't get through the round number. We talked about 3000 being an important number. We couldn't get through the $2,000 level for four years and then we actually went lower two and a half years ago all the way down to 1620. And since then we sold 85% from the 1620 level all the way up to 3000. Now what's been driving this most recently, this latest, this huge spike has been, it's a number of things. We had obviously geopolitical turmoil in 2022. Russia became a problem with Ukraine, the Crime War. We also later had Middle East issues with the mass, the Hezbollah and all the groups there. So that created trouble and gold does well in periods of turmoil. In addition to that, we had had a lot of money printed, you know, $5 trillion around the COVID period. That's been in the system and we also have had what the organization of the dollar now tariffs. These are all catalysts to have foreigners buy more gold. And they're the ones that have been buying gold and central banks obviously have been, as we know, have been big buyers. They bought over a thousand tons in the last three years. Now we'd never seen that before that level. In fact, they went back in the high, like in 2013 and 18 with 600 tons. So you could see the how high they ratchet it up. They're buying to increase their reserves. And what they're doing is instead of increasing their treasury bonds and recycling the dollars they were getting into treasury bonds they were starting to buy gold. And the Chinese are a good example of that where they've taken their US treasury holdings down from 13 trillion to 750 billion. So not quite cut in half. That's the lowest level since 2009. So they're roping away slowly from having their reserves and treasuries and moving it into gold. And then is all one to central banks that have been doing that. All of basically all of the bricks in India has been a big buyer. Russia has been a big buyer. That we have others like Poland, which just bought 29 tons in February. So it's not even, it's not even just the bricks. It's some of the eastern countries like Czechoslovakia purchased it every month and Hungary has been buying. And so all over the world, the central banks have been buying and their people have been buying. And China, they've just encouraged their insurance companies to start a pilot program where they're allowed them to start buying gold. And so that could lead to hundreds of tons of gold. Additionally, there's 10 insurance companies that were allowed to do it in the first pilot program here. But also then their people have been buying. So the Chinese people, the Indians, they were all buyers as well. So we had everyone essentially, except for the North American spine buying gold over this period of time. And that's been propelling gold higher here. And one question I have in my mind is, are we going to go through a period of indigestion where we have trouble getting through 3000 though, you know, 3000 just as we did in 2000. And that might happen. I think we're over a bot in gold right now. If you look at the DSI, I don't have the latest number, but it was close to 80, right? You know what? I'll give it to you right now, actually. Yesterday it was, bear with me one second. It was 77. Silver was 81. But it's been in the low 70s. It hasn't gotten kind of wild yet. Yeah, I think it's the 90. You better run out. You know, you get out of town, you know, because that's a pretty dangerous level. But the, you know, the RSI is up to 70. That's a very dangerous level. Managed money is relatively elevated. I don't like the headlines. I like the headlines that I saw two and a half years ago in 2018 from the Wall Street Journal where they said gold had lost its safe haven status. Well, today we're seeing headlines that says nothing can stop gold. Or this morning's headline from McWary that they were putting their target price up to 3500. So a little bit concerned in the short term that you could get a correction. You could get peace in the, in the Ukraine area. There's talk of quite a bit of chatter about that. That was a catalyst. That could cause us outlaw. So it's certainly riskier than it was when I was buying, and no, when Ed Bell was too, and no one wanted to buy it at all. And that's basically, I think, where we are right now. Now, having said that, having said that long term, the central banks are going to continue buying gold. And right now the Fed is on pause. But since I believe this is a big super bubble that's breaking and that will lead to recession, then we're going to almost certainly, I believe, have the Fed come in and once again, print money. I don't think cutting rates will work. We saw that didn't work in 2000. In the mid 2000, it didn't work. It didn't work at the early 2000s when we had bubbles break then. It's going to require more money printing in order to stabilize the system again. And so that would be another catalyst to gold. And how high it can go? I have no idea. It all depends on how much money they print and how far this goes with the bond market craters. You know, who knows? Who knows? I think there's one dichotomy that you and I've talked about in the past in that right now we've got a certain amount of enthusiasm amongst the select few players, North American players like the CTA community. And we've seen the open interest build a little bit here recently. But what we haven't had yet is any enthusiasm really from institutional types as manifested by inflows into the GLD or even the GDX. Yeah, we finally saw that in February. We pulled in a hundred tons globally, 72 tons from the North American ETFs. But that was really the first we've seen. Otherwise, there's been no indication of any interest. So I guess we could get a shake out from the hot money sector. And perhaps finally into that dip maybe we'll start to see some real North American interest. I'll have an anecdote I'll share with you since I haven't talked to you. So I've been told you I was speaking with John Halfaway a couple of days ago and he said that they're starting to get inquiries at the institutional level from big entities. They're just starting to look into it. So maybe whatever correction we get will marry up with a flood of new investors and we can finally get to that leg. Well, the other thing I thought the reason why the North Americans were interested and this goes for Europe too is that everybody who was pouring money into the Mag 7, those seven stocks accounted for over 35% of the S&P at the end of last year. They accounted for 55% of the gain. If you weren't in these things and if you're a global money manager, you were going to underperform. And so far there's doubled their position in US equities to $17 trillion over a five year period. All this money poured into here and now we're starting to see it come out. And so you saw it inflows. Four week inflows, very largely seen in a long time into European stocks and European stocks that they'll well. And that's probably why we're starting to see some inflows into gold at the same time. But it's all at least just starting. With that as a backdrop, let's talk about the gold mining stocks because this is something that you I think are probably the best analysts down the street looking at these gold stocks. And yet despite what gold's done and it's been a very long consistent round. We haven't seen kind of a crazy spike that's called people off guard. We've seen a really steady 50% increase in the price of gold. And yet the gold stocks for the vast majority of them at least have shown no sign or any interest in participating in that. Can you help people understand that kind of looking at this and scratching their heads the way I have been? Is that just fatigue from so many false daunes for gold mining stocks? Is that a comment on how poorly they've been run? Is it a comment on an oversaturation in ETFs? What is it you think that's caused them to really lag behind this time on a meaningful rise? And do you see any signs of that changing? I mean, I'm seeing it slightly at the edges, but nothing concrete at the moment. Well, we're certainly not seeing much. You know, here's the statistic for you, the GDX, although the past year has gone from 427,000 shares outstanding to 331,000 shares. I was saying, as gold has soared here, almost $900. I mean, it's just stunning, right? Well, again, it gets into what were they chasing? They were chasing Tesla. They were chasing Nvidia. They were chasing all of these things. And that's starting to change. And we'll talk about that. I'm sure as to why it's going to change and why it's going to continue to get worse for the Mac 7 and tech in general. But you also mentioned some of the companies would poorly run. There's no doubt about it. And a lot of people have memories of what occurred in recent times when gold went over 2,000, the miners did great. And then they totally collapsed. The GDX and GDXJ, this is a 70% decline. And so it takes a while for that bitter taste and people's mouths to leave. And there are all these arguments that are out there. Well, the gold miners could never, the costs keep rising all the time. Well, that's a false argument right now because their margins absolutely soaring. They're all reporting record everything, record cash flows, record earnings, record production. You name it. But that's left over from what had happened when they did manage poorly. And their costs did run faster than they should have. They made bad acquisitions at the near the top. But it's interesting because we've seen gold go up 85% since that 2022 bottom that I talked about at 1620. The miners have gone up to so GDX has doubled since that time. But the largest gold miner in the world, new mocks only up 8%. Barric is only up 20%. Now, those companies have problems. They're in bad jurisdictions, they're poorly run, they make bad acquisitions. And that's a reason why they haven't gone anywhere. And so people have stayed away from them. But if you're in the miners that are well run, if there was that stay out of the bad jurisdictions, then you've had a terrific time of it. Acticulous tripled. Alamos has quadrupled. New gold is up 500% of five. And those, they've done what you would expect miners to do when gold goes up gold almost doubles. So that's really what's happened. Now, the barges are getting so terrific here. In the last, last quarter of the margins went up to $1,200 an ounce. So we had a gold price of 2662. And we had all insistending costs of 1,400. And it was a $1,200 margin around that level. Now, that's the highest that we had ever seen in 2020 was $884. So this is significantly higher. But that was at 2662 and cube four. Now, it's an average for the first quarter. This quarter, it's 2820. Well, that's almost a $1,400 margin. If you use today's spot price, that's over $1,500 margin. These things are incredible. You go to see, we saw big numbers. We saw a record everything from the Alamos as an Agnico's and a lot of those last quarter. We're going to see that again. And it's even going to push up likely here. Because the institutions are, we'll get involved. They'll start to buy no more because it's big and it's liquid and it's in the S&P. So I actually bought a little, I've been dabbling at it. Not that I relate a lot to, but I've just been renting it a bit here and there. I'm in it again right now. I guess this was the point I wanted to get to Fred because all the names you mentioned there, the names that perform really well, are all names that you've liked. They're all names that you've been in. They're all names that to your subscribers you've been pounding the table on for a considerable period of time. And so I want to try and help people understand who look at these and there's going to be a lot of people who get sucked into the precious metals mining space now because it is starting to make sense to even the most blinkered of investors. But give people a little bit of a sense of what you look for because you're your your your picks amongst these mining companies have been I mean so precise and so good for a number of years now. And you've avoided all the pitfalls and all the stocks that have broken people's hearts. So help people understand how you go about doing that because it's it's a tricky space because new people to the space are going to look at barrack. They are going to look at new one. They are going to look at these majors because they're the names that jump out when you Google Gold stocks, you know. Well, the management's are very important. And the ones that I was involved in, you know, the biggest and world bigger ones I got, Nico and Elimos, those management teams have been in place for quite a while. They've had a long record of success. They didn't make the mistakes that the others did by, you know, while the buying, you know, copper companies at the top and or, you know, doing what they were doing, overpaying for big acquisitions to get growth like new mod has done. And so the management teams and they're generally very conservative people. They never bite off more than they can chew. They they they they'll do they're not in a just for growth for growth. They're always talk about shareholder value and all the conference calls and all the meetings that you might hear them. It's always about shareholder value. It's always about driving cash flow and not revenues, not top-line lip revenues. These ones that also they're also in, you know, they'll come out and say, Alamos and and Agnico and these other companies will say, we have no intention of going into any areas. Agnico says it's I want to be the sleep at night stock where you can sleep well and not worry about having your mind confiscated or in Barrett's case having your employees could nap to our health hostage until you made paid hundreds of millions of dollars. All the crazy things that happened in this world and one of the problems right now is with the call to three thousand dollars and the finances of many of these countries where gold is located, the temptation is the is ever greater now for them to grab to get more and to do things like Miley just did, which was a seat. They were the holding hostage, not just barracks, but other other companies as well. So I've avoided all of those things and also I look for hopefully growth. If you know, these companies had growth, also projects, project pipelines. Right now, both in the last conference call and the last meetings, both the CEOs at Agnico and Alamos said they've never seen better pipelines than they had before. They don't have to go out and buy anything. They're fine. In Alamos's case, there are 500,000 or something per year and they have a runway of all established projects that will take them up to a million ounces per year. They don't have to look anywhere else. And so what I'm wondering for the miners was a way to benefit from this rising gold price that I thought for all the reasons we talked about, this rising gold price without taking risks. At the least amount of risk that could possibly take. And if I could get growth from that, that was a great thing as well. And you left out one factor, Fred, all of the companies that you like and I like for the most part, obviously, new gold's not the same have higher grade. You have to be careful. You don't want to be in the business of washing dirt because when you have low grade mines, more bad things happen than if you have high grade mines. And I learned that from experience from, I've been in this now for 25 years, you know, and I learned that you get these under one gram per ton and there's always seems to be problems with that. So yeah, I look for the highest grades. I meant to mention that too. I forgot it, but the high grades are really important as well because it gives you room for any kind of problems. You know, that might occur. Stuff happens in the mining business, but you won't be crushed if your grades are high and you can and you have enough mines. And I like to put a lot of money into single mines and I never know what might go wrong. You know, that's a dangerous thing. We saw Victoria goals. You know, ever real problem in this doctor's collapse, even though that was in Canada and and you can't. So I had a break of a tailings dam and it just was totally disastrous. Yet that was a well thought of management team and well thought of or body, but basically, guys, it was a single mine, just the shareholders were destroyed on that. So I've always tried to stay away from single mines as well. Let's talk about the acquisition stage of this because you talked about the problems that the new months and the barracks have had and they have got problems from reserve standpoints and they've historically not spent that money well and they've gone out to make acquisitions. Are the agnicoes, the alamos, the new goals of the world, are they safe from acquisition now? Are they big enough to have fended off the big boys or do you see any kind of major acquisitions happening in the space? Certainly. Agnicoes has this second largest market cap to new mine now. Believe we've seen these blockbuster deals in the space before. I don't think the shareholder base would want it. I don't think so. I know I know alamos wouldn't be interested in that either. In terms of new goal, they have an issue. They're two-mind company. One of them has a long runway new after in British Columbia. It's a copper bowl mine. Based off of what we're seeing there in the New Zollins that they discovered, they have a lot a long, long way to go. So that's a great mine. It will continue. It's been going on for many years as it is and over a decade and will continue to do so. But their other gold mine is called Rainy River and that reserve life only goes out to 2032 or so. And so they are going to be looking to do an acquisition or more. They won't do it right away as I understand it. They're going to show just some amazing numbers over the next year plus just staggering kind of numbers because their costs are going to come down so much. Both of the mines are kind of getting in-sake at the same time. The costs are going to come crashing down and the margins are going to just explode. The cash flow is going to be great. And that should lead to a much stronger gold price. And then I know if Adria Goedead wants to use that higher gold price to then do an acquisition or acquisitions that would solve their mind life longer term issue. So certainly in Newgold's case that is a risk because we don't know how well they'll do with that. Now we'll say they go in as a pretty strong track record and this experienced guy. So we'll see how it goes. And the other hand Fred, what do you mean Richard O'Brien is the chairman and his tenancy has been to be a seller, not an acquirer. So how do you feel about the prospect that maybe Newgold being sold to someone? Well as one where the chairman may want it and I don't know about the company management team might might not want it. They're looking at acquisitions but they might not have any choice. Newgold would fit in really well. Those two mines would fit in really well with another company that kind of cash flows that they will generate. And in that case I think the shareholders would sell that one if it was a good price. So there's a risk of a takeout in Newgold. It considered to be one of the most attractive takeover candidates in Canada. And they want to help you couple. Why don't we also talk about one other one that we both happen to like that's pretty uniquely positioned after a stumble. And as long as folks are going to use this as a somewhat of a primer to go to work on, why don't you talk about about Weston Fred? Weston's case here. It's done well. It's in that time frame that I talked about the two and a half year time frame. It is up 141%. So it's had a good move. Off of that low, they have two very high grade mines. The mills they have in both of them are underutilized significantly and have quite a bit of wrong to sell if they fill that and they have a plan to do so. They have projects around both of them where they can bring in more or and this is high grade, very high grade or this is the highest grade or that you can find. It's over 10 grams for ton in both cases here. You just don't see that in this industry anymore very much. So they're going to try to fill those mills. Their numbers have been great. I mean, they're going to show 26 cents in this quarter. They're going to report next week, which means that and estimates are for over a dollar next. This is in the US dollars now. Our over a dollar, man, it's a $10 stock. So it's a 10 PE yet it's growth rate could be dramatic as they bring in this or from the other deposit they've already identified. They haven't quite gone through all the steps that they need to do, but they've identified these things and they're going to be bringing them in. One of them they're going to be bringing in this year, starting this year. And so they're going to fill the mills when you do that, your costs go even lower. So your costs go down, your revenues go off, your margins are probably even more and yet it's a 10 PE. I mean, it also, by the way, new balls at a 10 PE too, I think I have tremendous numbers as well. So there are some, there are some really cheap stocks still out there that are pretty high quality, not of the quality of animals are at Nico, but pretty good. And then on the other hand, there's a lot things to avoid. And I think part of the problem is, as you and I've sifted through these over the years, there aren't that many choices that will tick the template that you listed as to what matters for you. I think people that are looking to understand the industry and the sector are going to find they're going to have to say no way more often than they say yes to a potential idea because of some of the pitfalls that you've highlighted. And I think that's an important takeaway that people need to have. There are thousands of companies that you could choose from thousands, literally thousands. The Frazier Institute in Canada puts out a list of the best jurisdictions every year. The last of most recent one they had showed that five of the top jurisdictions in the world were in Canada, so the different provinces. Three of them were in the US and two were in Australia. Okay, there's only three countries that have the top 10, only three. And those are the best places to be. Now Molly is down there in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the list and all of these places, all of you know, much of parts of Africa, you know, you don't want to be owned mines in Russia. Okay, it's appropriated or now parts of Latin America or socialist or run the countries. It ends up narrowing the list of companies that are possible in my country with very small number, relatively small number. You take that thousands down to a small number that I look at. Maybe we should shift gears and talk about some of the things that may undermine the enthusiasm for stocks, which might up the enthusiasm for gold. Fred, there's a very much hyped up area that you've got a contrary opinion about. Maybe you'll talk to a little bit about AI. To start, AI is real. It's been around for 17 years, not 17, 17 years. Okay, I've watched it grow slowly, throughout my whole career, but always slowly. But we got into this circumstances in 2022, where the tech industry didn't have anything to look forward to. The smartphone market was mature, the same thing with the PC market, those are the two biggest end markets for technology. They had a short-term, spurn and growth related to COVID when they were handing out STEMI checks. Then they were looking at negative growth following that and then they continued or just single-digit growth. In 2022, OpenAI came up with a version of Chatchee BT that Microsoft looked at and said, gee, that's interesting. This is called Generative AI. It's kind of an offshoot of AI. AI was used over all this time. I mean, lots of things. World calls, auto-fill on your phone, factory floors of using AI everywhere. Robotics is AI. All of that's AI, but this is very specific. Basically, they were going to take all the information in the internet and they extracted, if you were able to ask questions, it would be a much better search engine. That's what it was going to be. Microsoft said, gee, we've made no gains at all with our Bing search engine. This looks like it's a better search engine. If we invest in OpenAI, we can get a jump on Google and take away what they have essentially monopoly almost for search. They poured a bunch of money into OpenAI and then they said, they were going to be buying a bunch of their own GPUs and they were going to start going at this. When Google sell that, I don't remember how to understand. Only companies have lots of money. Microsoft had lots of cash. Google had tons of cash. They generate lots of cash flow. They all do. All the hyperscalers. Google said, we can't let Microsoft do this. We need to get involved too. They jumped in. Then Amazon and Meta and others said, this is the then they started hearing about this. This is going to be the greatest thing since I spread. So Mr. Lada jacket in video, which is the biggest beneficiary of this, which is latest is you'll hear this. We just heard this. AI is advancing at the speed of light as a genetic and physical AI set the stage for the next wave of AI to revolutionize the largest industries in the country. This is the kind of stuff that comes out. He's done that for 25 years as long as I've all easily ultimate optimist. But in this case, because he did some big numbers because everybody started pouring money into this thing, he got a lot of press, a lot more than he normally did. He's covered with the superstar of the industry. But it became what was someone termed a cycle of competitive escalation. So everybody had to pour more money into what was this generative AI area. And the problem is is that there's no killer app. There are flaws. There's tremendous hallucinations, bad data. Companies don't really want to use it. I saw a Wall Street Journal in February had a network summit of chief information office. These are the tech guys. And they said there's some value in this generative AI stuff, but not enough. They haven't yet started using the technology in a widespread way. But we've seen the poor money into this generative AI area to the point where these four alone have $325 billion that they're going to spend this year on CapEx spending up 46% from last year. It is crazy. Now I've seen this before. Would you have stock bubbles? And when there's too much money, and in this case, you also have guys who are the richest people in the world, and there are stocks of the largest in the world. There's massive egos involved. And we saw this in 2000 when they built 20 times more fiber optic capacity than they built all kinds of computer server and networking equipment than they needed. And it took over a decade for it wasn't that the internet was real. It wasn't really was. But it took forever then to worth that off. The problem now is is that it started to affect their numbers, the hyperscalers numbers. I have to understand when you spend to $325 billion or $250 billion last year, that was went right into the technology world's earnings. So Nvidia and Broadcom and MD, you know, some of the, any, Dell, Stels had big rolled near server business, although the rest of this is no good. So they're having trouble. But all these companies are benefiting now. But the costs have gone on the balance sheet because they spread these costs over five to six years. Okay, that's what they depreciate this this equipment that they're buying, these chips that they're buying, they're depreciating them over five to six years. And by the way, they've extended those years from what was three to four years up to five to six years. In fact, meta just increased there is from four and a half to five and a half just as last quarter. What that does is it means that you're only getting 20% of the cost. Now you're getting 100% of the benefit into the industry and only 20% of the cost. Now that changes with time because each year that you go by, you get in other years worth of depreciation. So in Microsoft's case, they're spending $80 billion this year on capEx. They only had $15 billion of depreciation. But they say it's going to go higher and it is. And it's going to go higher each and every year. And in Google's case, same thing. They have another, they're increasing their spife 46% their CFO and last quarter is called war and that margins in a current quarter are going to go down because their depreciation rate is increased by 28%. Now this is starting to impact the cash flows of these companies. In Microsoft's case, their free cash flow has gone from 23 billion in Q2 to 19 billion in Q3 to just 6 billion in Q4 because they're spending all this money. But no one's getting any revenue. The only one that's getting any revenue is open AI itself. They've generated $4 billion worth of revenue and it costs them $9 billion to get it. So for every $1 for prop money, they lose to not a great business model. And Microsoft trying to do what they can, they just raised the price of Office 365 for the consumer by 50%. But they're trying to force it on them because they have basically monopoly. Everybody else, they just make a different way for free. Meta free. They're embedding into their products. Same thing with Google now. So there's not that the revenue is not being generated and their costs are increasing and the cash flow as they increase the spending each year every year is declining. In Meta's power sign to see buybacks decline because the cash flows are shrinking. So in Meta's case, their buyback in Q2 of last year was 15 billion. The buyback in Q3 was 8 billion. The buyback in Q3 was a goose egg zero. Now all of them are cutting other employees. They're cutting out consulting. They're cutting out human resources people. They're even cutting out cloud people. Every single one of these hyper skills Amazon Meta Microsoft, all of them, all reducing headcount because they know they have this rapidly increasing depreciation expense that's going to hit their bottom lines, their P and Ls. And if you remember last quarter, everybody missed numbers except for Meta. And Meta was the only one that raised their depreciation length of time. It was the only one that did that. But everybody else missed numbers in their revenue growth isn't there. So this month we've seen Salesforce, which is big in what's called agentic AI, which is using generative AI. They disappointed the market because you're talking looking at single digit revenue growth. And their CFO came out and said on the conference call that even though they've hyped this mark Benoff is hyped this to death. She admitted that their agent for software was only going to make a modest contribution to fiscal year 2026. There's no revenue here yet their cluster rise. That's why the max is funny. They all have fallen. Meta Amazon Apple is not really hyper scalar Microsoft Google all have fallen by 19 to 21% off their highs all of them the same amount it's like all at once. And it didn't start just here. It started with a reporting numbers really. With people are starting to ask a lot more questions on the comments goes the economics don't make sense. How can you continue spending to this level when Microsoft recently just a couple of weeks few weeks ago said that they well they didn't say it but so a county company put out a report saying that they were cutting back on some of their capital leases. The whole group collapsed. It's like, oh, no, we're spending it. They're still spending 80 billion dollars. That's the sensitivity that people have now to this problem that they're not able to generate revenues because they're not really generating anything useful for anyone here or not as much as not that it doesn't generate anything useful. It's just not enough to generate revenue and to offset these costs. So these companies that accounted for 35.4% of the max seven most of the myper scalers of the S&P a record level and that accounted for 55% of last year's game and most of the gain again to get two back-to-back years in the S&P of 20% plus they've got problems really for the first time I can remember and it's not going to get any better. We're two and a half years into this now and they still haven't come up with anything significant. There's study after study that I see Columbia Gerald came out with the one just very release of the show and all kinds of queries error rates even deep seek the hallucination rate on the latest version of deep seek is 14%. Tell them what happened to a good friend of ours who apparently died. Oh just about to say that was very distressing. So there was an article in the Wall Street Journal last month. They have no ability to admit that they don't know the answer right that was the essential the article that they had you can't say no these so they just make up stuff. And so I said yeah I'm going to ask a question I'll just ask a simple question. How all this Fred Hickey the high tech strategist and when was he born okay that should be easy enough. Well I was told I was born on July no I'm not more in July 24th I was born on the 24th in 1943 which I'm not that old okay I'm not that old and then they added they added he passed away on September 20th 2024. I didn't even ask them that thing but that's the kind of hallucination that you're going to get here with this. It's not to know Fred I mean it's good enough to tell you. I was happy I didn't do my taxes this year. I was like I'm off this newsletters monthly newsletters at 38 years I'd like to get beat up I wasn't was a little distressed though. Well people today that haven't been around technology of their whole lives as you have been and parent that like me too have forgotten about one thing. Garbage in garbage out and that's that's one of the problems with this. And I would probably have now is so they basically have they have trained all this data all the internet everything else they can find so now they're training some of this bad data and that's good back to the answers to get it worse because now they think that I was born on in 1943 and so nothing the results are even worse so I saw just this has been all over the tech world. So the latest version of open AIs for it's called 4.5 they spat like 10 to 15 times more training this right and they got no improvements at all in the results in fact some ways worse so they hit the wall on what they can do here they're not close to what they all like to talk about which is human television. No we're near Facebook chief AI scientist last year called said that this stuff this generator stuff doesn't even have the intelligent of a cat but this is how crazy things can get when there's too much money thank you for that right when you've printed too much money and you have a super bubble and you're kind of desperate for growth and you're chasing the other guys this is how you lose your mind and that's how they lost their mind in 2002. I know you can see cracks in this story now and if you think back to the cracks that we saw when the 2000 bubble blew up and especially some of the internet wannabes and infrastructure companies how do you see this playing out as we start to head towards disappointment which is inevitable and closer wherever it is can you get your crystal ball out and say how you think this plays out much of it comes down to liquidity although lack thereof now we were breaking the market in 2021 we had the craziness where Kathy Woods are went to 160 dollars with NFTs with SPACs with all that craziness and the valuations are actually higher than they were at the peak today and the market cracked in 2022 and the Nasick fell 33% now those mad sevens cut crunched and video lost two thirds of its value Apple was the best performer it lost 30% in four months time but the others lost metal lost 70 something percent Amazon lost 57% I mean they were getting destroyed in the same way that bubble stocks were destroyed in 2000 but then the Fed had printed five trillion dollars during COVID during 2020-21 and only two and a half trillion of that two and a half of the five trillion only two and a half made its way into the system now because they were handing out steamy checks to people quite a bit of the money ended up in people's pockets and you read it up the highest inflation rates in four decades right but two and a half trillion of that was sterilized and what was called the RIS repo account the RRP so they had two and a half trillion dollars sitting there that was sterilized it wasn't getting into the system now go back and QE1 QE2 QE3 those were going into the financial system almost all ways not into the hands of consumers this was leading to the asset price inflation that we've seen from 2009 all the way on all those QE's but this one they did in 2020 only half of it went in to the system and a lot of it went to consumers but they had this two and a half trillion dollar sitting in this RRP account so the market was getting craier then and it was affecting numbers the economy was weakening quite a bit at that point by the end of 2022 with the wealth effect happening jade gone far away that if she could raise short-term treasury bill rates higher than the money that they were paying the RRP because we're paying back the whole this two and a half trillion we were paying it was two and a half trillion dollars we were paying them and interest rate to hold it there if the treasury rates were higher the money would come out of the RRP and come into treasury and that would be that being into the financial system but once again into asset prices not into the consumers hands she was doing predominantly bills the heaviest percentage of bills that were received to fund the government that RRP account went from two and a half trillion dollars in the end of 2022 down to one trillion by the end of 2023 that was one and a half trillion dollars injected into the financial system and then last year 260 billion dollars or another 750 billion dollars essentially into the financial system and then now we're at 113 billion as of yesterday which is basically nothing it's completely wiped out there is no more money they could tap into at the same time you're still doing qt quantity of tightening at well 50 to 60 billion dollars it's a little less than I was but it's still 50 to 60 billion dollars per month so that's taking money out of the system the money that people had gotten during covid led to what was they said two trillion dollars of excess savings that's all gone now to and now they're saying it's a negative 800 billion dollars and that's leading to what well we're seeing every retailer come out basically in the last few weeks saying from target to Walmart they'll you name it saying the account of his saking and retail consumers aren't spending the holding back at all levels all income levels we saw that today with Michigan consumer sentiment where all income levels all geographies the sentiment numbers were deteriorating very rapidly so even in we had a travel boom going on because a lot of the money was in the high end people the one that had held their savings for the longest time and so travel was booming up until just recently and then just this week we heard from american in southwest and jet blue and and delta all of them saying that they're seeing slowdowns in travel now that's high in spending right so and we see that everywhere there's only two things that were driving the economy here at the end and that was government spending at AI AI I spent this this hundreds of billions and all is AI now government spending is going to be declining here as well soon as we start to see the doge layoffs and then we have the potential immigration impact a few were people coming into the country or maybe more going out certainly that's the case right now so all of these factors are affecting the quiddy that one of the factors too I talked about the amount of money that poured in from foreign into the u.s equity market it went from nine to 17 trillion dollars right well we're starting to see that go out too right what is performing now it's not the s and p it's not the nasdaq down 14% from the tie right now they're talking correction that's your pain stocks it's shani stocks it's other it's other areas so money is leaving the money that had come in is also leaving the system as well so all of these factors are aligning now to squeeze liquidity and that's why I think it's it's this liquidity squeeze that is overwhelmed even the passives and and so that's why these the passive investment flows that the auto-mounted you go into apple and all of these companies at the highest market caps now they're sinking now they're all sinking now they'll probably a rally next week because in video I don't tell anybody but I actually own some Nvidia calls right now careful yeah oh my god you're in a lot of sin right I have sin but I saw all my Nvidia puts and I bought calls this week and I'll sell them next week because I know this is a lot of jackets gonna go up there and high pipe and if they're gonna have a rally at all it'll be around that right so and it has worked out I've already taken all my costs out of it but so you've got a short term rally here but the liquidity effects aren't going to change the fact is on pause they can't do anything and as I said I don't think Ray cuts will do it they have it in the past in big bubbles and we're not at a point where especially with inflation you saw again in the University of Michigan numbers today the inflation expectation numbers went up a lot they went up to 4.9 percent over the next year and the long term rate went to the highest and down like 20 years over that was 25 years the highest level so they're not able to print at this point until things get really ugly in the stock market so I think any rally you have here will be short term in nature do you think that the Fed will be slower to act than they otherwise would be because I don't think it's a secret that the Fed is pretty liberal leading and they don't like so I was wondering if they'll drag their feet just because because they can't stand Trump they have an excuse too because the tariffs are inflationary we know that right we already seen tech companies raise prices acer is going to raise notebook prices they announced that they have no choice they're in China they have a lot of productions in China so you could see it so that's inflationary for anybody in the US buying acer notebooks and that's the way it's going to be all by the way 42 process of what we can port is computers and electronics from China so watch your electronics prices all go up but everything else we get from them as well and then we have tariffs everywhere seemingly we don't even know they're all up everywhere they're in Europe they're in there in Mexico they're in China they're who knows where they'll be on April 2nd there's all this uncertainty and so as when there's uncertainty yet they know that the tariffs are inflationary they have an excuse not to do anything and they don't have to say it's it's political if that's all like Trump what's been very very interesting and you've just done a great job there of laying out what's actually happening from the ground up and when I read your letter every month it's astounding because what you've just done there verbally you do in written form and you paint a picture of the reality of a lot of these sectors a lot of the economy as a whole and yet there's this smoke screen from the top down that everybody seems able to hide behind which is they talk about the crazy Trump tariffs they talk about these big macro shifts in either positioning or attitude or the status towards different countries and that gives the cover that people seemingly say well the market's down 20% but it's because of Trump it's because of tariffs it's because of the dollar all these huge macro reasons for the companies being down but the reality from where you come in it from the bottom up paint a completely different picture one of much weaker economic activity a much weaker consumer and importantly real reasons why these companies are going to perform poorly that aren't macro related these are very company specific very economy specific very consumer specific reasons for the poor performance that are likely to continue how do you marry those two and how should people think about this because the picture you describe is the real picture to me and you paint it very clearly each month but the picture that everybody's being fed by every single news out there from CNBC I never know Bill do CNBC on down or CNBC on up depending on where you said the right never quite know which way to go with them but you know what I mean yeah yeah it's by the way Grant it's called bubble vision it's not the industry yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah BBV but the picture that's being painted relentlessly by everybody to everybody is the economies fine the companies are fine this is just a kind of fog that we're in now because of Trump because of tariffs because of this how do you square those and how should people really be thinking about this stuff it seems like most people have an agenda so if you're all Wall Street you want stocks to go up they all benefit from that they don't benefit much from when the markets are down people will stop getting being interested and they will be involved so they have an agenda economists there always seems to be bullish only know a couple that are ever bearish they'd never call part of it was just because they're canyons are all canyons and they don't understand they've always stated all the systems work but they never they never see things in advance they're always in their models and the models are back we're looking or wrong and they can never seem to get the answer they want admit that they're wrong they never do the press obviously has an agenda depending on whether you're you know in any of the cases they're liberal so they'll have that agenda they don't want things to go a certain way towards the Republicans and if you're if your Fox News then you're going to have a different agenda completely there's very few independent voices out there I sit there in New Hampshire for a new Hampshire without putting the agenda I don't think I don't have that agenda very independent a live for your diet country and I only benefit a mum right I don't care I try to stay out of politics you never see me talking about that in the in the letter I as far as I'll go up or down on the market I only want to get value and be able to make money on a lower prices that's what counts for me and for as an economist I want to be exactly in the opposite camp of them always so it's just a different it's just different there aren't many independent voices out there I happen to be one with those one you are one as well we're a small number it sounds like the market's kind of hanging on by its fingernails of starter roll over it seems quite possible that there's problems beneath the service at the company level it sounds to me like you feel there's a decent and I want to put words in your mouth that you feel like there's a decent chance when we get to Q1 earnings reports which will be in another what six weeks or so there could start to be some problems and that could be a catalyst for real trouble for the stock market and parenthetically that could make gold look better as well is that fair to say they cred the fourth quarter numbers were not good and even the ones that are reported sent or are disappointed in a sales force disappointed so all those companies came in with you with lower revenues or lower margins or whatever and disappointed Wall Street and the problem is is that you can't disappoint Wall Street when you have a super bubble as Jeremy Granitham talks about it and this is a important point I think this isn't just a run of the bill well we can get a very market thing this is only seen in your lifetime a couple of times maybe you just heard from Paul Tutor Jones it said that if the market fell 30% it would still be over there about right Leo Cooper when it came out and said I'm selling and I'm building cash and you know Paul's saying everyone the greatest investors ever said this is as risky a market as I've ever seen he's 80 years plus years old right Warren Buffett has the largest cash position ever as do you for it as do you I think I have a big one too but not like that that not even close not even in the same I'm a peep squeak but all of these you know the legends are all saying there's this is really dangerous stuff and so when you have a bubble like this anything could perk a bubble and you know these tariffs should be doing it but we were going to go down anyways as I said we were starting to go down in 2021 but then we got this this lift from the liquidity that came in so you know that's very dangerous so the earnings are declining they're going to continue to climb there'll be a lot more names the airlines we weren't hearing from them before they really was fine before retail wasn't as bad as what they said you know the high end was still spending we're gonna hear a lot of commentary with they say the ion isn't bending anymore and why would they there's a lot of uncertainty there's job losses there's you know and always by the way don't look at them employment numbers they're lagging and that's what the economists look at they're worthless right there the laggy is the most lagging of numbers they'll look good and then the NBER will come in a year later and say we're in our session but you know housing is been bad that's true production might have got a little bit of a pickup because people were producing to get the products into the US people were the tariffs but that's not going to be good so you're going to have a very broad I think a negative tone to the earnings reports to come out but it's not going to be it's just going to be worse than last quarter it already started it's not anything that just just happened in the last few weeks just coming back to the precious matters we didn't talk about silver I know you don't focus on it as much but I know in the past and I know now you you have some silver positions what are your thoughts on silver because if you look at the chart you're going to perform to the metal it's finally starting to come to life again and the three of us all know what can happen when silver gets going well silver always lags gold so it has lag gold and it's also called poor man's gold so the institutions will buy gold the central banks will put big bars into their reserves but they don't buck silver into the reserves and the institutions don't buy it's just too bulky so it's retail that doesn't and we talked about why retail wasn't interested in gold miners for the same reason they were interested in silver they were chasing other things we've now seen silver right up to the old highs here that it is stalled out before if it gets another dollar or two irons going to be a breakout and that will get the retail people more excited as well the declines in the big cap mag stocks as they start to look for things that are performing right gold is obviously performed very well and then they say cheap silver hasn't yet and it does the storyline will become I got to get involved in silver and the problem for me is very difficult to find good silver miner companies I have some S.L.V. position but it's hard finding the good silver pure silver companies so I think it could get going it could get wild silver is always wild once a good gold I have two friends who are big locals and really close to the silver market for a long time and one of them shared this idea and I think it's useful for folks to have in their heads and that is silver is not a market it's a personality and its personality is wild so if you look at it and expect it to be wild then when you approach that market you'll size it up correctly a lot of people I think don't appreciate that part of it meaning silver looks like it trades you know a small spread but the real market is about two dollars wide I remember the I go soaring to fifty dollars it's absolutely crazy crazy yeah when it gets wild you're off no kidding well it's sort of like it's the same kind of people that buy you know Bitcoin it's speculators right real speculators or even worse you know farcorn and dogecoin and all the other reality is silver is not a big market so when any amount of money wants to get in there they get a move to price and both directions so that's why that happens I've just seen we've kept you little longer than we plan to but it's been well worth the weight I'm glad we finally got this together and thanks for doing it on the correct day we will see what happens next week when all the earnings start to come out but again you know I'm not going to even ask you to plug the highest tech strategy because I'm going to do that for you because I probably shall do a much better job because you're far too humble I appreciate that I'll give you a work the plug it deserves I usually get everything wrong to the dad dresses and I'll reflect but I also tell them where to follow on Twitter and again Fred as I said you've been such a voice of sanity for me in these markets for a long time I've for Bill for even longer I'm sure yeah Fred we're going to make you blush when we talk about you all right okay all right well I appreciate all that you guys are obviously two great ones as well and this is my pleasure to you to speak to you today every Fred just one last thing you just just promised that you'll let Bill and I know when the funeral is because we're going to come down there for your funeral because it must be any week now already happened the I said in my death notice the IRS yeah okay Fred listen enjoy the warm weather for a couple more weeks and the best of luck real climateizing to new Hampshire when you get back up there all righty thank you five well mate what is they to say about Fred he is absolutely just one of the best isn't he he's the single best analyst I've ever seen I've said that many many times I think so too when I first met him in around 1995 his newsletter was 95 bucks and the first conversation of them I had I said you got to raise your prices this is ridiculous hero is getting reams of research from all over Wall Street and I think yeah he's moved it up to I think it's $135 but anyone who has an ounce of interest in the financial markets that doesn't take his service is just dumb I completely agree it's so I mean how you cannot spend the money to read what he has to say is beyond my comprehension I completely great and anybody listening to this that doesn't get Fred's word I mean again it's so old school there's no website just email Fred and Kathy at the high tech strategist at Yahoo dot com he's got a Yahoo email let's tell you how old this thing is exactly the high tech strategist at Yahoo dot com email Fred and Kathy and I promise you it will be the best I think it's 150 bucks now flick it'll be the best 150 bucks you have spent and if you cannot make money on that 150 bucks that's your full not Fred's I promise you you should stay in tea bills yeah that is absolutely your full not Fred's Fred's also on Twitter he doesn't post much but every now then what he posts this worth reading yeah I say everything he does right is something we worth reading and you'll find him at HTS F Hicky that's high tech strategist Fred Hicky as Hicky with an E well how do we find you mate how do we find you me just turn over a rock then you'll normally find me scutling it out from under there flick other than that you can find me at TTNYGH and you I dare say a still at flak cap at flak cap and always will be this is our thanks to Fred Hicky for joining us again the high tech strategist at Yahoo dot com please please please do yourself a favor and sign up for Fred's work and follow him on Twitter bill and I will be back with another episode in our seemingly endless quest to find the endgame and then also just a future but in the meantime as always thank you very much for listening nothing we discussed during the endgame should be considered as investment advice this conversation is for informational and hopefully entertainment purposes only so while we hope you find it both informative and entertaining please do your own research or speak to a financial advisor before putting a dime of your money into these crazy markets",
    "speaker_identification": "Bill Fleckenstein: Before we get going, here's a bit where I remind you that nothing we discussed during the endgame should be considered as investment advice. This conversation is for informational and hopefully entertainment purposes only. So while we hope you find it both informative and entertaining, please do your own research or speak to a financial advisor before putting a dime of your money into these crazy markets. And now, on with the show. Welcome everybody to another edition of the endgame. Joining me for a conversation we've been dying to have a month now is the man himself, the great Bill Fleckas-Dyber, how are the devil are you? I'm just fine and how are you? It's been a while since we've gotten together. It's been a while. It's been a while. This conversation in particular, we have been trying to get on the calendar for what? Six months I think? Yeah, Fred is a very busy fellow, especially when he's down in Costa Rica. He's extra busy. Extra hard to get, shall we say. But it's funny Bill, you know, we tried to get this done. I think about six months ago, we first tried to do it and Fred was busy and then he was traveling and he was going to be down in Costa Rica. And so we put this date in the diary a couple of months ago and we're recording this on the 14th of March and one of the odds after six months of waiting that we would record this the day gold goes through the $3,000 baritone. I can't believe you're surprised what the day we made the date I went on bought $3,000 calls, didn't you? No, I should have done. I was too busy trading monkey jay. Why did it fall to the... Oh, yeah, because you were probably planning on with Bitcoin working out. Yeah, I was just buying the set of monkey jay pigs just regular Thursday. But listen, you know, this is a conversation that I've been looking forward to for so long because of all the voices in the gold space, Fred for me is the one that I listened to the most and he's also the one who brings the whole narrative of gold itself.\n\nGrant Williams: but also the gold mining stocks in. And his technological bent as well given what I suspect everyone's going to be selling to buy their gold stocks when the panic starts could not be any more apropos I don't think for this conversation. Well, I mean, Fred is literally a world-class analyst. You could have him follow a forest products in no time. He'd no more than 95% of the people who look on the subject. So he and I were been kind of locked together in battle through the tech craze and into the medals and it took a while to get the hang I think of of the ins and outs and the mining stocks, but now he's as good as any analyst you'll find probably better than 99% of the others. The only guys who might be better or long-time insiders to know the geology and mine engineering ice cold, and that's a small group of people. And frankly, that's not the knowledge you need, I think, for the people that are going to listen to this. You don't need to know how to offer it a mine. No, but you need to be sure that the person you're listening to knows how it works. There are gazillion gold stocks and pick a number. Probably 75% are garbage. Maybe that's too harsh, but I mean, garbage in the sense that they're just going to behave like gold does it best because they have nothing special in their mining business and garbage is unfair, but they don't have anything extra, but the price of gold. That's what I mean to say.\n\nBill Fleckenstein: I completely agree. Well, listen, I tell you what, you and I can sit here and talk about gold all day long, but the people listening, they're drumming their thumbs on their desk, pressing that 15-second forward button until they hear Fred's voice. So why don't we bring them in?\n\nGrant Williams: Okay. Well Fred, welcome to the end game. It's an absolute joy to see you again after quite some time. And Bill and I are particularly excited to have you to talk to because Hungarian politics is obviously the most important subject of the day and who better to talk about it than you? How do you\n\nGrant Williams: I think we'll start with gold because as Bill and I were saying at the top of the show, we just recorded that before you joined us, having set this conversation up months ago, we happened to be recording it on the day that gold's gone through to $3,000 mark.\n\nGrant Williams: So I give you the broadest question imaginable because I know you think about this stuff a lot and nobody writes about it as well as you. So let's just if we can start off with just your general thoughts on gold, the metal rather than the mining socks we'll get into those later, where it is, what's put it there and what you think the things that are going to drive it in the months to come.\n\nGrant Williams: So we've been on a bull market, I say we've been a bull market since the end of 2015 and that's when gold bottomed at $1050, it's tripled now since then. It hit $2,000 recently, and that was around the same time that we had a lot of money being printed related to COVID.\n\nGrant Williams: Now what's been driving this most recently, this latest, this huge spike has been, it's a number of things. We had obviously geopolitical turmoil in 2022. Russia became a problem with Ukraine, the Crime War. We also later had Middle East issues with the mass, the Hezbollah and all the groups there. So that created trouble and gold does well in periods of turmoil. In addition to that, we had had a lot of money printed.\n\nFred Hickey: Gold does well in periods of turmoil.\n\nFred Hickey: know, $5 trillion around the COVID period. That's been in the system and we also have had what the organization of the dollar now tariffs. These are all catalysts to have foreigners buy more gold. And they're the ones that have been buying gold and central banks obviously have been, as we know, have been big buyers. They bought over a thousand tons in the last three years. Now we'd never seen that before that level. In fact, they went back in the high, like in 2013 and 18 with 600 tons. So you could see the how high they ratchet it up. They're buying to increase their reserves. And what they're doing is instead of increasing their treasury bonds and recycling the dollars they were getting into treasury bonds they were starting to buy gold. And the Chinese are a good example of that where they've taken their US treasury holdings down from 13 trillion to 750 billion. So not quite cut in half. That's the lowest level since 2009. So they're roping away slowly from having their reserves and treasuries and moving it into gold. And then is all one to central banks that have been doing that. All of basically all of the bricks in India has been a big buyer. Russia has been a big buyer. That we have others like Poland, which just bought 29 tons in February. So it's not even, it's not even just the bricks. It's some of the eastern countries like Czechoslovakia purchased it every month and Hungary has been buying. And so all over the world, the central banks have been buying and their people have been buying. And China, they've just encouraged their insurance companies to start a pilot program where they're allowed them to start buying gold. And so that could lead to hundreds of tons of gold. Additionally, there's 10 insurance companies that were allowed to do it in the first pilot program here. But also then their people have been buying. So the Chinese people, the Indians, they were all buyers as well. So we had everyone essentially, except for the North American spine buying\n\nFred Hickey: gold over this period of time. And that's been propelling gold higher here. And one question I have in my mind is, are we going to go through a period of indigestion where we have trouble getting through 3000 though, you know, 3000 just as we did in 2000. And that might happen. I think we're over a bot in gold right now. If you look at the DSI, I don't have the latest number, but it was close to 80, right? You know what? I'll give it to you right now, actually. Yesterday it was, bear with me one second. It was 77. Silver was 81. But it's been in the low 70s. It hasn't gotten kind of wild yet. Yeah, I think it's the 90. You better run out. You know, you get out of town, you know, because that's a pretty dangerous level. But the, you know, the RSI is up to 70. That's a very dangerous level. Managed money is relatively elevated. I don't like the headlines. I like the headlines that I saw two and a half years ago in 2018 from the Wall Street Journal where they said gold had lost its safe haven status. Well, today we're seeing headlines that says nothing can stop gold. Or this morning's headline from McWary that they were putting their target price up to 3500. So a little bit concerned in the short term that you could get a correction. You could get peace in the, in the Ukraine area. There's talk of quite a bit of chatter about that. That was a catalyst. That could cause us outlaw. So it's certainly riskier than it was when I was buying, and no, when Ed Bell was too, and no one wanted to buy it at all. And that's basically, I think, where we are right now. Now, having said that, having said that long term, the central banks are going to continue buying gold. And right now the Fed is on pause. But since I believe this is a big super bubble that's breaking and that will lead to recession, then we're going to almost certainly, I believe, have the Fed come in and once again, print money. I don't think cutting rates will work. We saw that didn't work in 2000. In the mid 2000,\n\nBill Fleckenstein: it didn't work. It didn't work at the early 2000s when we had bubbles break then. It's going to require more money printing in order to stabilize the system again. And so that would be another catalyst to gold. And how high it can go? I have no idea. It all depends on how much money they print and how far this goes with the bond market craters. You know, who knows? Who knows? I think there's one dichotomy that you and I've talked about in the past in that right now we've got a certain amount of enthusiasm amongst the select few players, North American players like the CTA community. And we've seen the open interest build a little bit here recently. But what we haven't had yet is any enthusiasm really from institutional types as manifested by inflows into the GLD or even the GDX. Yeah, we finally saw that in February. We pulled in a hundred tons globally, 72 tons from the North American ETFs. But that was really the first we've seen. Otherwise, there's been no indication of any interest. So I guess we could get a shake out from the hot money sector. And perhaps finally into that dip maybe we'll start to see some real North American interest. I'll have an anecdote I'll share with you since I haven't talked to you. So I've been told you I was speaking with John Halfaway a couple of days ago and he said that they're starting to get inquiries at the institutional level from big entities. They're just starting to look into it. So maybe whatever correction we get will marry up with a flood of new investors and we can finally get to that leg. Well, the other thing I thought the reason why the North Americans were interested and this goes for Europe too is that everybody who was pouring money into the Mag 7, those seven stocks accounted for over 35% of the S&P at the end of last year. They accounted for 55% of the gain. If you weren't in these things and if you're a global money manager, you were going to underperform. And so far there's doubled their position in US equities\n\nGrant Williams: And so you saw it inflows. Four week inflows, very largely seen in a long time into European stocks and European stocks that they'll well. \nGrant Williams: And that's probably why we're starting to see some inflows into gold at the same time. \nGrant Williams: But it's all at least just starting. \nGrant Williams: Let's talk about the gold mining stocks because this is something that you I think are probably the best analysts down the street looking at these gold stocks. \nGrant Williams: And yet despite what gold's done and it's been a very long consistent round. \nGrant Williams: We haven't seen kind of a crazy spike that's called people off guard. \nGrant Williams: We've seen a really steady 50% increase in the price of gold. \nGrant Williams: And yet the gold stocks for the vast majority of them at least have shown no sign or any interest in participating in that. \nGrant Williams: Can you help people understand that kind of looking at this and scratching their heads the way I have been? \nGrant Williams: Is that just fatigue from so many false daunes for gold mining stocks? \nGrant Williams: Is that a comment on how poorly they've been run? \nGrant Williams: Is it a comment on an oversaturation in ETFs? \nGrant Williams: What is it you think that's caused them to really lag behind this time on a meaningful rise? \nGrant Williams: And do you see any signs of that changing? \nGrant Williams: I mean, I'm seeing it slightly at the edges, but nothing concrete at the moment. \nBill Fleckenstein: Here's the statistic for you, the GDX, although the past year has gone from 427,000 shares outstanding to 331,000 shares. \nBill Fleckenstein: Well, again, it gets into what were they chasing? They were chasing Tesla. They were chasing Nvidia. They were chasing all of these things.\n\n\nFred Hickey: would poorly run. There's no doubt about it. And a lot of people have memories of what occurred in recent times when gold went over 2,000, the miners did great. And then they totally collapsed. The GDX and GDXJ, this is a 70% decline. And so it takes a while for that bitter taste and people's mouths to leave. And there are all these arguments that are out there. Well, the gold miners could never, the costs keep rising all the time. Well, that's a false argument right now because their margins absolutely soaring. They're all reporting record everything, record cash flows, record earnings, record production. You name it. But that's left over from what had happened when they did manage poorly. And their costs did run faster than they should have. They made bad acquisitions at the near the top. But it's interesting because we've seen gold go up 85% since that 2022 bottom that I talked about at 1620. The miners have gone up to so GDX has doubled since that time. But the largest gold miner in the world, new mocks only up 8%. Barric is only up 20%. Now, those companies have problems. They're in bad jurisdictions, they're poorly run, they make bad acquisitions. And that's a reason why they haven't gone anywhere. And so people have stayed away from them. But if you're in the miners that are well run, if there was that stay out of the bad jurisdictions, then you've had a terrific time of it. Acticulous tripled. Alamos has quadrupled. New gold is up 500% of five. And those, they've done what you would expect miners to do when gold goes up gold almost doubles. So that's really what's happened. Now, the barges are getting so terrific here. In the last, last quarter of the margins went up to $1,200 an ounce. So we had a gold price of 2662. And we had all insistending costs of 1,400. And it was a $1,200 margin around that level. Now, that's the highest that we had ever seen in 2020 was $884. So this is significantly higher. But that was at 2662 and cube four. Now, it's an average\n\nFred Hickey: for the first quarter. This quarter, it's 2820. Well, that's almost a $1,400 margin. If you use today's spot price, that's over $1,500 margin. These things are incredible. You go to see, we saw big numbers. We saw a record everything from the Alamos as an Agnico's and a lot of those last quarter. We're going to see that again. And it's even going to push up likely here. Because the institutions are, we'll get involved. They'll start to buy no more because it's big and it's liquid and it's in the S&P. So I actually bought a little, I've been dabbling at it. Not that I relate a lot to, but I've just been renting it a bit here and there. I'm in it again right now. I guess this was the point I wanted to get to Fred because all the names you mentioned there, the names that perform really well, are all names that you've liked. They're all names that you've been in. They're all names that to your subscribers you've been pounding the table on for a considerable period of time. And so I want to try and help people understand who look at these and there's going to be a lot of people who get sucked into the precious metals mining space now because it is starting to make sense to even the most blinkered of investors. But give people a little bit of a sense of what you look for because you're your your your picks amongst these mining companies have been I mean so precise and so good for a number of years now. And you've avoided all the pitfalls and all the stocks that have broken people's hearts. So help people understand how you go about doing that because it's it's a tricky space because new people to the space are going to look at barrack. They are going to look at new one. They are going to look at these majors because they're the names that jump out when you Google Gold stocks, you know. Well, the management's are very important. And the ones that I was involved in, you know, the biggest and world bigger ones I got, Nico and Elimos, those management teams have been in place\n\nHost 1: \"Speaker: ...for quite a while. They've had a long record of success. They didn't make the mistakes that the others did by, you know, while the buying, you know, copper companies at the top and or, you know, doing what they were doing, overpaying for big acquisitions to get growth like Newmont has done. And so the management teams and they're generally very conservative people...\"\n\nFred Hickey: have a runway of all established projects that will take them up to a million ounces per year. They don't have to look anywhere else. And so what I'm wondering for the miners was a way to benefit from this rising gold price that I thought for all the reasons we talked about, this rising gold price without taking risks. At the least amount of risk that could possibly take. And if I could get growth from that, that was a great thing as well. And you left out one factor, Fred, all of the companies that you like and I like for the most part, obviously, new gold's not the same have higher grade. You have to be careful. You don't want to be in the business of washing dirt because when you have low grade mines, more bad things happen than if you have high grade mines. And I learned that from experience from, I've been in this now for 25 years, you know, and I learned that you get these under one gram per ton and there's always seems to be problems with that. So yeah, I look for the highest grades. I meant to mention that too. I forgot it, but the high grades are really important as well because it gives you room for any kind of problems. You know, that might occur. Stuff happens in the mining business, but you won't be crushed if your grades are high and you can and you have enough mines. And I like to put a lot of money into single mines and I never know what might go wrong. You know, that's a dangerous thing. We saw Victoria goals. You know, ever real problem in this doctor's collapse, even though that was in Canada and and you can't. So I had a break of a tailings dam and it just was totally disastrous. Yet that was a well thought of management team and well thought of or body, but basically, guys, it was a single mine, just the shareholders were destroyed on that. So I've always tried to stay away from single mines as well. Let's talk about the acquisition stage of this because you talked about the problems that the new months and the barracks have had and they have got\n\nFred Hickey: problems from reserve standpoints and they've historically not spent that money well and they've gone out to make acquisitions. Are the agnicoes, the alamos, the new goals of the world, are they safe from acquisition now? Are they big enough to have fended off the big boys or do you see any kind of major acquisitions happening in the space? Certainly. Agnicoes has this second largest market cap to new mine now. Believe we've seen these blockbuster deals in the space before. I don't think the shareholder base would want it. I don't think so. I know I know alamos wouldn't be interested in that either. In terms of new goal, they have an issue. They're two-mind company. One of them has a long runway new after in British Columbia. It's a copper bowl mine. Based off of what we're seeing there in the New Zollins that they discovered, they have a lot a long, long way to go. So that's a great mine. It will continue. It's been going on for many years as it is and over a decade and will continue to do so. But their other gold mine is called Rainy River and that reserve life only goes out to 2032 or so. And so they are going to be looking to do an acquisition or more. They won't do it right away as I understand it. They're going to show just some amazing numbers over the next year plus just staggering kind of numbers because their costs are going to come down so much. Both of the mines are kind of getting in-sake at the same time. The costs are going to come crashing down and the margins are going to just explode. The cash flow is going to be great. And that should lead to a much stronger gold price. And then I know if Adria Goedead wants to use that higher gold price to then do an acquisition or acquisitions that would solve their mind life longer term issue. So certainly in Newgold's case that is a risk because we don't know how well they'll do with that. Now we'll say they go in as a pretty strong track record and this experienced guy. So we'll see how it goes. And the other\n\nHost 1: \"hand Fred, what do you mean Richard O'Brien is the chairman and his tenancy has been to be a seller, not an acquirer. So how do you feel about the prospect that maybe Newgold being sold to someone?\"\nFred Hickey: \"Well as one where the chairman may want it and I don't know about the company management team might might not want it. They're looking at acquisitions but they might not have any choice. Newgold would fit in really well. Those two mines would fit in really well with another company that kind of cash flows that they will generate. And in that case I think the shareholders would sell that one if it was a good price. So there's a risk of a takeout in Newgold. It considered to be one of the most attractive takeover candidates in Canada.\"\nHost 2: \"Why don't we also talk about one other one that we both happen to like that's pretty uniquely positioned after a stumble. And as long as folks are going to use this as a somewhat of a primer to go to work on, why don't you talk about about Weston Fred?\"\nFred Hickey: \"Weston's case here. It's done well. It's in that time frame that I talked about the two and a half year time frame. It is up 141%. So it's had a good move. Off of that low, they have two very high grade mines. The mills they have in both of them are underutilized significantly and have quite a bit of wrong to sell if they fill that and they have a plan to do so. They have projects around both of them where they can bring in more or and this is high grade, very high grade or this is the highest grade or that you can find. It's over 10 grams for ton in both cases here. You just don't see that in this industry anymore very much. So they're going to try to fill those mills. Their numbers have been great. I mean, they're going to show 26 cents in this quarter. They're going to report next week, which means that and estimates are for over a dollar next. This is in the US dollars now. Our over a dollar, man, it's a $10 stock. So it's a 10 PE yet it's growth rate could\"\n\nHost 2: be dramatic as they bring in this or from the other deposit they've already identified. They haven't quite gone through all the steps that they need to do, but they've identified these things and they're going to be bringing them in. One of them they're going to be bringing in this year, starting this year. And so they're going to fill the mills when you do that, your costs go even lower. So your costs go down, your revenues go off, your margins are probably even more and yet it's a 10 PE. I mean, it also, by the way, new balls at a 10 PE too, I think I have tremendous numbers as well. So there are some, there are some really cheap stocks still out there that are pretty high quality, not of the quality of animals are at Nico, but pretty good. And then on the other hand, there's a lot things to avoid. And I think part of the problem is, as you and I've sifted through these over the years, there aren't that many choices that will tick the template that you listed as to what matters for you. I think people that are looking to understand the industry and the sector are going to find they're going to have to say no way more often than they say yes to a potential idea because of some of the pitfalls that you've highlighted. And I think that's an important takeaway that people need to have. There are thousands of companies that you could choose from thousands, literally thousands. The Frazier Institute in Canada puts out a list of the best jurisdictions every year. The last of most recent one they had showed that five of the top jurisdictions in the world were in Canada, so the different provinces. Three of them were in the US and two were in Australia. Okay, there's only three countries that have the top 10, only three. And those are the best places to be. Now Molly is down there in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the list and all of these places, all of you know, much of parts of Africa, you know, you don't want to be owned mines in Russia. Okay, it's appropriated or now parts of\n\nFred Hickey: Latin America or socialist or run the countries. It ends up narrowing the list of companies that are possible in my country with very small number, relatively small number. Maybe we should shift gears and talk about some of the things that may undermine the enthusiasm for stocks, which might up the enthusiasm for gold. Fred, there's a very much hyped up area that you've got a contrary opinion about. Maybe you'll talk to a little bit about AI. To start, AI is real. It's been around for 17 years, not 17, 17 years. Okay, I've watched it grow slowly, throughout my whole career, but always slowly. But we got into this circumstances in 2022, where the tech industry didn't have anything to look forward to. The smartphone market was mature, the same thing with the PC market, those are the two biggest end markets for technology. They had a short-term, spurn and growth related to COVID when they were handing out STEMI checks. Then they were looking at negative growth following that and then they continued or just single-digit growth. In 2022, OpenAI came up with a version of Chatchee BT that Microsoft looked at and said, gee, that's interesting. This is called Generative AI. It's kind of an offshoot of AI. AI was used over all this time. I mean, lots of things. World calls, auto-fill on your phone, factory floors of using AI everywhere. Robotics is AI. All of that's AI, but this is very specific. Basically, they were going to take all the information in the internet and they extracted, if you were able to ask questions, it would be a much better search engine. That's what it was going to be. Microsoft said, gee, we've made no gains at all with our Bing search engine. This looks like it's a better search engine. If we invest in OpenAI, we can get a jump on Google and take away what they have essentially monopoly almost for search. They poured a bunch of money into OpenAI and then they said, they were going to be buying\n\nBill Fleckenstein: a bunch of their own GPUs and they were going to start going at this. When Google sell that, I don't remember how to understand. Only companies have lots of money. Microsoft had lots of cash. Google had tons of cash. They generate lots of cash flow. They all do. All the hyperscalers. Google said, we can't let Microsoft do this. We need to get involved too. They jumped in. Then Amazon and Meta and others said, this is the then they started hearing about this. This is going to be the greatest thing since I spread. So Mr. Lada jacket in video, which is the biggest beneficiary of this, which is latest is you'll hear this. We just heard this. AI is advancing at the speed of light as a genetic and physical AI set the stage for the next wave of AI to revolutionize the largest industries in the country. This is the kind of stuff that comes out. He's done that for 25 years as long as I've all easily ultimate optimist. But in this case, because he did some big numbers because everybody started pouring money into this thing, he got a lot of press, a lot more than he normally did. He's covered with the superstar of the industry. But it became what was someone termed a cycle of competitive escalation. So everybody had to pour more money into what was this generative AI area. And the problem is is that there's no killer app. There are flaws. There's tremendous hallucinations, bad data. Companies don't really want to use it. I saw a Wall Street Journal in February had a network summit of chief information office. These are the tech guys. And they said there's some value in this generative AI stuff, but not enough. They haven't yet started using the technology in a widespread way. But we've seen the poor money into this generative AI area to the point where these four alone have $325 billion that they're going to spend this year on CapEx spending up 46% from last year. It is crazy. Now I've seen this before. Would you have stock bubbles? And when there's too much money, and in this\n\nFred Hickey: In this case, you also have guys who are the richest people in the world, and there are stocks of the largest in the world. There's massive egos involved. And we saw this in 2000 when they built 20 times more fiber optic capacity than they built all kinds of computer server and networking equipment than they needed. And it took over a decade for it wasn't that the internet was real. It wasn't really was. But it took forever then to worth that off. The problem now is is that it started to affect their numbers, the hyperscalers numbers. I have to understand when you spend to $325 billion or $250 billion last year, that was went right into the technology world's earnings. So Nvidia and Broadcom and MD, you know, some of the, any, Dell, Stels had big rolled near server business, although the rest of this is no good. So they're having trouble. But all these companies are benefiting now. But the costs have gone on the balance sheet because they spread these costs over five to six years. Okay, that's what they depreciate this this equipment that they're buying, these chips that they're buying, they're depreciating them over five to six years. And by the way, they've extended those years from what was three to four years up to five to six years. In fact, meta just increased there is from four and a half to five and a half just as last quarter. What that does is it means that you're only getting 20% of the cost. Now you're getting 100% of the benefit into the industry and only 20% of the cost. Now that changes with time because each year that you go by, you get in other years worth of depreciation. So in Microsoft's case, they're spending $80 billion this year on capEx. They only had $15 billion of depreciation. But they say it's going to go higher and it is. And it's going to go higher each and every year. And in Google's case, same thing. They have another, they're increasing their spife 46% their CFO and last quarter is called war and that margins in a current quarter are going to\n\nHost: Fred Hickey\n\nBill Fleckenstein: They disappointed the market because you're talking looking at single digit revenue growth. And their CFO came out and said on the conference call that even though they've hyped this mark Benoff is hyped this to death. She admitted that their agent for software was only going to make a modest contribution to fiscal year 2026. There's no revenue here yet their cluster rise. That's why the max is funny. They all have fallen. Meta Amazon Apple is not really hyper scalar Microsoft Google all have fallen by 19 to 21% off their highs all of them the same amount it's like all at once. And it didn't start just here. It started with a reporting numbers really. With people are starting to ask a lot more questions on the comments goes the economics don't make sense. How can you continue spending to this level when Microsoft recently just a couple of weeks few weeks ago said that they well they didn't say it but so a county company put out a report saying that they were cutting back on some of their capital leases. The whole group collapsed. It's like, oh, no, we're spending it. They're still spending 80 billion dollars. That's the sensitivity that people have now to this problem that they're not able to generate revenues because they're not really generating anything useful for anyone here or not as much as not that it doesn't generate anything useful. It's just not enough to generate revenue and to offset these costs. So these companies that accounted for 35.4% of the max seven most of the myper scalers of the S&P a record level and that accounted for 55% of last year's gain and most of the gain again to get two back-to-back years in the S&P of 20% plus they've got problems really for the first time I can remember and it's not going to get any better. We're two and a half years into this now and they still haven't come up with anything significant. There's study after study that I see Columbia Gerald came out with the one just very release of the show and all kinds of queries\n\nGrant Williams: error rates even deep seek the hallucination rate on the latest version of deep seek is 14%. Tell them what happened to a good friend of ours who apparently died. Oh just about to say that was very distressing. So there was an article in the Wall Street Journal last month. They have no ability to admit that they don't know the answer right that was the essential the article that they had you can't say no these so they just make up stuff. And so I said yeah I'm going to ask a question I'll just ask a simple question. How all this Fred Hickey the high tech strategist and when was he born okay that should be easy enough. Well I was told I was born on July no I'm not more in July 24th I was born on the 24th in 1943 which I'm not that old okay I'm not that old and then they added they added he passed away on September 20th 2024. I didn't even ask them that thing but that's the kind of hallucination that you're going to get here with this. It's not to know Fred I mean it's good enough to tell you. I was happy I didn't do my taxes this year. I was like I'm off this newsletters monthly newsletters at 38 years I'd like to get beat up I wasn't was a little distressed though. Well people today that haven't been around technology of their whole lives as you have been and parent that like me too have forgotten about one thing. Garbage in garbage out and that's that's one of the problems with this. And I would probably have now is so they basically have they have trained all this data all the internet everything else they can find so now they're training some of this bad data and that's good back to the answers to get it worse because now they think that I was born on in 1943 and so nothing the results are even worse so I saw just this has been all over the tech world. So the latest version of open AIs for it's called 4.5 they spat like 10 to 15 times more training this right and they got no improvements at all in the results in fact some ways worse so they hit the wall on what they\n\nFred Hickey: can do here they're not close to what they all like to talk about which is human television. No we're near Facebook chief AI scientist last year called said that this stuff this generator stuff doesn't even have the intelligent of a cat but this is how crazy things can get when there's too much money thank you for that right when you've printed too much money and you have a super bubble and you're kind of desperate for growth and you're chasing the other guys this is how you lose your mind and that's how they lost their mind in 2002. I know you can see cracks in this story now and if you think back to the cracks that we saw when the 2000 bubble blew up and especially some of the internet wannabes and infrastructure companies how do you see this playing out as we start to head towards disappointment which is inevitable and closer wherever it is can you get your crystal ball out and say how you think this plays out much of it comes down to liquidity although lack thereof now we were breaking the market in 2021 we had the craziness where Kathy Woods are went to 160 dollars with NFTs with SPACs with all that craziness and the valuations are actually higher than they were at the peak today and the market cracked in 2022 and the Nasick fell 33% now those mad sevens cut crunched and video lost two thirds of its value Apple was the best performer it lost 30% in four months time but the others lost metal lost 70 something percent Amazon lost 57% I mean they were getting destroyed in the same way that bubble stocks were destroyed in 2000 but then the Fed had printed five trillion dollars during COVID during 2020-21 and only two and a half trillion of that two and a half of the five trillion only two and a half made its way into the system now because they were handing out steamy checks to people quite a bit of the money ended up in people's pockets and you read it up the highest inflation rates in four decades right but two and a half trillion of that was sterilized and what\n\nBill Fleckenstein: ...was called the RIS repo account the RRP so they had two and a half trillion dollars sitting there that was sterilized it wasn't getting into the system now go back and QE1 QE2 QE3 those were going into the financial system almost all ways not into the hands of consumers this was leading to the asset price inflation that we've seen from 2009 all the way on all those QE's but this one they did in 2020 only half of it went in to the system and a lot of it went to consumers but they had this two and a half trillion dollar sitting in this RRP account so the market was getting craier then and it was affecting numbers the economy was weakening quite a bit at that point by the end of 2022 with the wealth effect happening jade gone far away that if she could raise short-term treasury bill rates higher than the money that they were paying the RRP because we're paying back the whole this two and a half trillion we were paying it was two and a half trillion dollars we were paying them and interest rate to hold it there if the treasury rates were higher the money would come out of the RRP and come into treasury and that would be that being into the financial system but once again into asset prices not into...\n\nFred Hickey: ...consumers hands she was doing predominantly bills the heaviest percentage of bills that were received to fund the government that RRP account went from two and a half trillion dollars in the end of 2022 down to one trillion by the end of 2023 that was one and a half trillion dollars injected into the financial system and then last year 260 billion dollars or another 750 billion dollars essentially into the financial system and then now we're at 113 billion as of yesterday which is basically nothing it's completely wiped out there is no more money they could tap into at the same time you're still doing qt quantity of tightening at well 50 to 60 billion dollars it's a little less than I was but it's still 50 to 60 billion dollars per month so that's taking money out of the system.\n\nGrant Williams: The money that people had gotten during covid led to what was, they said, two trillion dollars of excess savings that's all gone now, and now they're saying it's a negative 800 billion dollars. And that's leading to what we're seeing, every retailer come out basically in the last few weeks saying from Target to Walmart, you name it, saying the accounts are sagging and the retail consumers aren't spending, they're holding back at all income levels. All income levels, all geographies, the sentiment numbers were deteriorating very rapidly, so even into we had a travel boom going on because a lot of the money was in the high-end, people, the ones that held their savings for the longest time, and so travel was booming up until just recently. And then just this week, we heard from American, Southwest, JetBlue, and Delta, all of them saying that they're seeing slowdowns in travel now. That's high-end spending, right? And we see that everywhere. There's only two things that were driving the economy here at the end, and that was government spending, AI, AI spent this hundreds of billions, and all this AI. Now government spending is going to be declining here as well, soon as we start to see the doge layoffs, and then we have the potential immigration impact, fewer people coming into the country or maybe more going out. Certainly, that's the case right now. So, all of these factors are affecting the economy. One of the factors too, I talked about the amount of money that poured in from foreign into the U.S. equity market. It went from 9 to 17 trillion dollars, right? Well, we're starting to see that go out too. Right now, what's performing, it's not the S&P, it's not the NASDAQ, down 14% from the time right now, they're talking correction, that's your Fang stocks, it's shiny stocks, it's other areas. So, money is leaving, the money that had come in is also leaving the system as well. So, all of these factors...\n\nSpeaker: Fred Hickey\n\nHost 1: \"that's inflationary for anybody in the US buying acer notebooks and that's the way it's going to be all by the way 42 process of what we can port is computers and electronics from China so watch your electronics prices all go up but everything else we get from them as well and then we have tariffs everywhere seemingly we don't even know they're all up everywhere they're in Europe they're in there in Mexico they're in China they're who knows where they'll be on April 2nd there's all this uncertainty and so as when there's uncertainty yet they know that the tariffs are inflationary they have an excuse not to do anything\"\nHost 2: \"and they don't have to say it's it's political if that's all like Trump what's been very very interesting and you've just done a great job there of laying out what's actually happening from the ground up and when I read your letter every month it's astounding because what you've just done there verbally you do in written form and you paint a picture of the reality of a lot of these sectors a lot of the economy as a whole and yet there's this smoke screen from the top down that everybody seems able to hide behind which is they talk about the crazy Trump tariffs they talk about these big macro shifts in either positioning or attitude or the status towards different countries and that gives the cover that people seemingly say well the market's down 20% but it's because of Trump it's because of tariffs it's because of the dollar all these huge macro reasons for the companies being down but the reality from where you come in it from the bottom up paint a completely different picture one of much weaker economic activity a much weaker consumer and importantly real reasons why these companies are going to perform poorly that aren't macro related these are very company specific very economy specific very consumer specific reasons for the poor performance that are likely to continue how do you marry those two and how\"\n\nBill Fleckenstein: should people think about this because the picture you describe is the real picture to me and you paint it very clearly each month but the picture that everybody's being fed by every single news out there from CNBC I never know Bill do CNBC on down or CNBC on up depending on where you said the right never quite know which way to go with them but you know what I mean yeah yeah it's by the way Grant it's called bubble vision it's not the industry yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah BBV but the picture that's being painted relentlessly by everybody to everybody is the economies fine the companies are fine this is just a kind of fog that we're in now because of Trump because of tariffs because of this how do you square those and how should people really be thinking about this stuff it seems like most people have an agenda so if you're all Wall Street you want stocks to go up they all benefit from that they don't benefit much from when the markets are down people will stop getting being interested and they will be involved so they have an agenda economists there always seems to be bullish only know a couple that are ever bearish they'd never call part of it was just because they're canyons are all canyons and they don't understand they've always stated all the systems work but they never they never see things in advance they're always in their models and the models are back we're looking or wrong and they can never seem to get the answer they want admit that they're wrong they never do the press obviously has an agenda depending on whether you're you know in any of the cases they're liberal so they'll have that agenda they don't want things to go a certain way towards the Republicans and if you're if your Fox News then you're going to have a different agenda completely there's very few independent voices out there I sit there in New Hampshire for a new Hampshire without putting the agenda I don't think I don't have that agenda very independent a live for your diet country and I only\n\nFred Hickey: benefit a mum right I don't care I try to stay out of politics you never see me talking about that in the in the letter I as far as I'll go up or down on the market I only want to get value and be able to make money on a lower prices that's what counts for me and for as an economist I want to be exactly in the opposite camp of them always so it's just a different it's just different there aren't many independent voices out there I happen to be one with those one you are one as well we're a small number it sounds like the market's kind of hanging on by its fingernails of starter roll over it seems quite possible that there's problems beneath the service at the company level it sounds to me like you feel there's a decent and I want to put words in your mouth that you feel like there's a decent chance when we get to Q1 earnings reports which will be in another what six weeks or so there could start to be some problems and that could be a catalyst for real trouble for the stock market and parenthetically that could make gold look better as well is that fair to say they Fred the fourth quarter numbers were not good and even the ones that are reported sent or are disappointed in a sales force disappointed so all those companies came in with you with lower revenues or lower margins or whatever and disappointed Wall Street and the problem is is that you can't disappoint Wall Street when you have a super bubble as Jeremy Granitham talks about it and this is a important point I think this isn't just a run of the bill well we can get a very market thing this is only seen in your lifetime a couple of times maybe you just heard from Paul Tutor Jones it said that if the market fell 30% it would still be over there about right Leo Cooper when it came out and said I'm selling and I'm building cash and you know Paul's saying everyone the greatest investors ever said this is as risky a market as I've ever seen he's 80 years plus years old right Warren Buffett has the largest cash position\n\nFred Hickey: ever as do you for it as do you I think I have a big one too but not like that that not even close not even in the same I'm a peep squeak but all of these you know the legends are all saying there's this is really dangerous stuff and so when you have a bubble like this anything could perk a bubble and you know these tariffs should be doing it but we were going to go down anyways as I said we were starting to go down in 2021 but then we got this this lift from the liquidity that came in so you know that's very dangerous so the earnings are declining they're going to continue to climb there'll be a lot more names the airlines we weren't hearing from them before they really was fine before retail wasn't as bad as what they said you know the high end was still spending we're gonna hear a lot of commentary with they say the ion isn't bending anymore and why would they there's a lot of uncertainty there's job losses there's you know and always by the way don't look at them employment numbers they're lagging and that's what the economists look at they're worthless right there the laggy is the most lagging of numbers they'll look good and then the NBER will come in a year later and say we're in our session but you know housing is been bad that's true production might have got a little bit of a pickup because people were producing to get the products into the US people were the tariffs but that's not going to be good so you're going to have a very broad I think a negative tone to the earnings reports to come out but it's not going to be it's just going to be worse than last quarter it already started it's not anything that just just happened in the last few weeks just coming back to the precious matters we didn't talk about silver I know you don't focus on it as much but I know in the past and I know now you you have some silver positions what are your thoughts on silver because if you look at the chart you're going to perform to the metal it's finally starting to come to life\n\nGrant Williams: again and the three of us all know what can happen when silver gets going well silver always lags gold so it has lag gold and it's also called poor man's gold so the institutions will buy gold the central banks will put big bars into their reserves but they don't book silver into the reserves and the institutions don't buy it's just too bulky so it's retail that doesn't and we talked about why retail wasn't interested in gold miners for the same reason they were interested in silver they were chasing other things we've now seen silver right up to the old highs here that it is stalled out before if it gets another dollar or two irons going to be a breakout and that will get the retail people more excited as well the declines in the big cap mag stocks as they start to look for things that are performing right gold is obviously performed very well and then they say cheap silver hasn't yet and it does the storyline will become I got to get involved in silver and the problem for me is very difficult to find good silver miner companies I have some S.L.V. position but it's hard finding the good silver pure silver companies so I think it could get going it could get wild silver is always wild once a good gold I have two friends who are big locals and really close to the silver market for a long time and one of them shared this idea and I think it's useful for folks to have in their heads and that is silver is not a market it's a personality and its personality is wild so if you look at it and expect it to be wild then when you approach that market you'll size it up correctly a lot of people I think don't appreciate that part of it meaning silver looks like it trades you know a small spread but the real market is about two dollars wide I remember the I go soaring to fifty dollars it's absolutely crazy crazy yeah when it gets wild you're off no kidding well it's sort of like it's the same kind of people that buy you know Bitcoin it's speculators right real speculators or even\n\nBill Fleckenstein: worse you know farcorn and dogecoin and all the other reality is silver is not a big market so when any amount of money wants to get in there they get a move to price and both directions so that's why that happens I've just seen we've kept you little longer than we plan to but it's been well worth the weight I'm glad we finally got this together and thanks for doing it on the correct day we will see what happens next week when all the earnings start to come out but again you know I'm not going to even ask you to plug the highest tech strategy because I'm going to do
